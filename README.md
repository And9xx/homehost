## Setup

Run `npm install` in the `client/` directory and the `server/` directory
Create a `.env` file in the `client/` directory, if it does not exist
In `.env`, set the base url of the homehost server 
###### **`.env`**
```env
REACT_APP_HOMEHOST_API = "http://localhost:5000/api"
REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE = "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/"
REACT_APP_TMDB_BASE = "https://www.imdb.com/title/"
```  
Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory, if it does not exist  
In `.env`, set the media paths, and set a working API key for TMDb API and Spotify Web API  
###### **`.env`**
```env
MOVIES_PATH = '/path/to/movies/directory'
MOVIES_API = 'api.themoviedb.org/3'
MOVIES_KEY = '<api_key>'

TV_PATH = '/path/to/tv/directory'
TV_API = 'api.themoviedb.org/3'
TV_KEY = '<api_key>'

MUSIC_PATH = '/path/to/music/directory'
MUSIC_API = 'api.spotify.com/v1'
MUSIC_KEY = '<api_key>'

CLIENT_BASE = 'http://localhost:3000'
```
If you dont have keys, you can request API authorization from Spotify at https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/, and TMDb at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction  

### Naming conventions

Your media must appear in the path set by `.env`  
üé• **Movies**  
```
<movies_path>  
 - (subdirectory)?  
   - (movie_file_name <TMDb-movie-ID>) (.mp4|.mkv)  
```
üì∫ **TV**  
```
<tv_path>  
 - (tv_show_directory_name <TMDb-tv-ID>)  
   - (S<season_number>E<episode_number> episode_file_name) (.mp4|.mkv)
```
üéµ **Music**  
```
<music_path>  
 - (album_directory_name <Spotify-album-ID>)  
   - ((<disc_number>-)?<track_number> track_file_name) (.mp3|.flac)  
```
Tracks not found on Spotify can be put in a directory titled `Unknown Album` sans disc/ track number
```
<music_path>  
 - Unknown Album  
   - (track_file_name) (.mp3|.flac)
```

### Generating metadata
 
Run `npm run start-dev` from the `server/` directory   
 
On the server, call `/api?generate` **once**. Wait for the async call to finish and save  
There is no 'watch' or 'hot reload' for server media. Adding or removing media files requires a server reset and recalling `/api?generate`  
<!-- `nodemon` will restart to file changes and interrupt async. Use `node server` instead for generating metadata.  
Run `ncu` in the base directory and in the `client/` directory to check for updates for `package.json`  -->

### Run

Run `npm run start-dev` from the `server/` directory to start the application  
By default the server port is `5000`, client port is `3000`
